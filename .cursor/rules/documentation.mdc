# Documentation Standards

This rule outlines the standards for documenting the project to ensure it is clear, presentable, and easy for others to understand.

### README.md
A comprehensive `README.md` file must be maintained at the project root. It is the primary source of documentation and should include the following sections:

1.  **Project Title:** A clear and descriptive title.
2.  **Objective:** A brief summary of the project's goal (e.g., "To predict employee attrition using Spark MLlib").
3.  **Tech Stack:** A list of the key technologies used (e.g., Scala, Spark, sbt).
4.  **Project Structure:** A brief explanation of the directory layout, highlighting important files (`build.sbt`, `src/main/scala/...`, `data/`).
5.  **How to Run:** Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to compile and run the application. This should include `sbt` commands.
6.  **Methodology:** A description of the machine learning pipeline, including:
    - Data loading and preprocessing steps.
    - Feature engineering choices.
    - Model selection and training.
7.  **Evaluation:** A summary of the model's performance metrics (e.g., AUC, Accuracy) and what they mean.

### Code Comments
- Add high-level comments to explain the purpose of major code blocks or functions (e.g., the `main` method, custom transformers).
- Avoid commenting on obvious code. Focus on the "why," not the "what."
- The primary, detailed documentation should live in the `README.md`, not in the code comments.
